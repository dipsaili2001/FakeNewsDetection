## Usage:-

- Clone my repository.
- Open CMD in working directory.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open project in any IDE(Pycharm or VSCode)
- Run `Fake_News_Det.py`, go to the `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- If you want to build your model with the some changes, you can check the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb`.
- You can check web app is working fine. Sometimes predictions may be wrong.

## Note
- This project is just for learning purpose, don't think, it can do work in real time, because model was trained on historic & limited data.
- For real time building of this kind of system, we need updated dataset and we need to build a model in particular interval of time, because news data can be updated in seconds, so our model should be also updated with the data.
